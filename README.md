## List of schemas

### flight_airports

| Columns | Data Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `name` | `string` | Name of the airport |
| `latitude` | `double` | Latitude of the airport |
| `longitude` | `double` | Longitude of the airport |
| `iata_code` | `string` | Three-letter IATA code for the airport, e.g. BOS. Usable as a primary key. |
| `mac_iata_code` | `string` | Three-letter IATA metropolitan area code for the airport, e.g. JFK is part of NYC. |
| `country_code` | `string` | Two letter ISO-3166 country code for this airport, e.g. US. |
| `continent_code` | `string` | Two letter ISO-3166 continent code for this airport, e.g. NA. |
| `currency_code` | `string` | Three letter ISO-4217 currency code, e.g. USD. |
| `timezone` | `string` | The timezone prevailing at the airport, e.g. America/New_York |
| `score` | `double` | An ad hoc measure of airport volume or importance, from 0-1. Provided for convenience, but you can probably do better than this without too much effort. |

### flight_schedules

 A table of past and future flight schedules, including their seat capacities and codes in a long table format. From Innovata.

Usage caveats:

If a flight has codeshares, it will have a row for every flight number. E.g. if there is one codeshare, there will be two rows, one for the operating carrier number and another for the codeshare. Set codeshareIndicator = 0 to filter out codeshares to avoid duplicates

If a flight has a hidden stop, it will have a row for all consecutive combinations of segment combinations. E.g. CX888 appears 3 times as HKG-JFK, HKG-YVR, and YVR-JFK as there is a hidden stop in YVR. Set stops = 0 to filter out flights with hidden stops to avoid duplicates

Flight schedules are subject to change. Innovata sends schedules on an approximately 4 week basis. Each schedule only contains flights for the future, so there may be schedule changes that happened in the previous 4 weeks that are unaccounted for. Moreover, flights scheduled for the future may change in future schedules. received_date is the date that we received the final innovata schedule for the flight; if received_date is in the future, it means that future innovata schedules may change the current information.
